# Programmierparadigmen – Aufgaben 1–9

In general, all tasks were framed around a common theme: buildings, housing structures, costs, quality of life, and long-term planning.
Most exercises required us to simulate different scenarios, compare building types over several decades, compute a score based on given rules, or design navigation and evacuation plans for interconnected structures.

We worked on all nine tasks as a team of three, applying the concepts we had just learned in the weekly lectures.

Programming Language used: Java.

### Tasks 1–3

Focus: Introduction to different programming styles

These introductory tasks dealt with basic modelling of buildings and their properties.
We had to learn how to collaborate, explore different programming styles, and combine them in small simulations. The goal was mostly to get comfortable with the structure of the project and the overall building theme.

### Task 4 — Object-Oriented Programming

This task introduced OOP with subtype relations, inheritance, substitutability, and assertions.

### Task 5 — Generics

Here we extended our building simulations using generic types, especially in combination with subtype relations.

### Task 6 — Dynamic Type Information

This exercise focused on runtime type checks and handling dynamic type information inside larger simulations.

### Task 7 — Covariance, Annotations & AOP

We worked with covariant type problems, Java annotations, and aspect-oriented programming.

### Task 8 — Functional & Applicative Programming

In this task we used functional programming concepts, lambdas, functional forms, and Java Streams.

### Task 9 — Parallel & Concurrent Programming

The final task focused on parallelism and multithreading, including pipelines and thread synchronisation.
